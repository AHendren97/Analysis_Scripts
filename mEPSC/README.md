Collection of mEPSC analysis scripts, see below for a brief description

## Subtraction.m  
*Script used to calculate the NMDAR current from a subtraction experiment*

## Access.m  
*Script used to view the change in AR over the course of a recording*

## TonicShift.m

**Note:** *Subtraction, Access and TonicShift likely to be packaged into a function together for ease of analysis*

## AutoPlot.m 
*Script used to open .tdms data and visualise the data with a rolling window of a selected region* 

## Noise.m 
*Script that runs through all summary.txt files produced by eventer and then plots (and saves) the a.u. SD noise levels

## Trimmer.m 
*Script that merely opens up the file with ephysIO, trims if necessary, then resaves it as `filename_trimmed.phy`
