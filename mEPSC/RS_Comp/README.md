# Offline Series Resistance Compensation 

Plans to develop a script to accurately compensate for series resistance changes throughout the course of longer recordings of smaller events such as mEPSCs.  

Will build off work by Christian Kleine ([RsCorrection.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/69249-offline-series-resistance-correction)) and Andrew Penn ([rscomp_Penn.m](https://github.com/acp29/Peaker/blob/master/manip/rscomp.m)) and outline the workflow below as i begin writing.
